# Iris Dataset

## Description
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used in machine learning and data analysis. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, classified into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is described by four features.

## Features
- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)

## Classes
- 0: Setosa
- 1: Versicolor
- 2: Virginica

## Source
This dataset was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and is publicly available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

## Usage
This dataset is commonly used for:
- Classification
- Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction

## Example Data
| SepalLength | SepalWidth | PetalLength | PetalWidth | Species    |
|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 5.1         | 3.5        | 1.4         | 0.2        | setosa     |
| 6.2         | 2.8        | 4.8         | 1.8        | virginica  |
